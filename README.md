# Language_Model

Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features; google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history. 
So a preloaded data is also stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly. 

I trained a Deep Learning model for next word prediction using Python. 

I used the Tensorflow and Keras library in Python for next word prediction model.

For making a Next Word Prediction model, I trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
